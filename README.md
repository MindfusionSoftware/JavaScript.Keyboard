# MindFusion.Keyboard for JavaScript: Interactive HTML5 Virtual Keyboard

## About MindFusion.Keyboard

MindFusion **JavaScript virtual keyboard** is written entirely in **JavaScript** and extends your application with keyboard functionality similar to that of touch-screen and mobile devices. The library gives you a fast and easy way to implement:

*   **text input** in a keyboardless environment;
*   **kiosk or POS user interfaces** with a limited number of input keys;
*   **accessibility features** for users with mobility impairments;
*   rendering of common words for your application as keys in the keyboard;

The API is intuitive to use. Key-press is handled by a special event. **Localization** is supported in a variety of languages.

**Styling** is done through **CSS themes**. The control is packed with a set of predefined themes. You can edit them or create your own themes from scratch.

You can choose among three **keyboard layout modes** – default, extended and compact.

## Getting Started

To run the samples locally:

1.  Navigate to the project root directory: `D:\Projects\GitHub\JavaScript.Keyboard`
